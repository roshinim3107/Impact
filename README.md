## VEHICLES
This prototype requires Python 3 with [xcube](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube/) as well as [xcube_sh](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-sh) plugin. You also need to be registered at [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) and setup the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to access the dataset using their xcube_sh API.

Before running this code, make sure you have xcube activated using conda.

```
conda activate xcube
```

## DESCRIPTION

This is a prototype for mapping possible vehicle locations using Sentinel 2 L2A dataset and storing their data in a NETCDF dataset. One can use QGIS to import the dataset and further analyse it as required.
